This year as an alumni mentor I guided a small team along with working on some specific issues. The issue I’m most proud of is issue 4030 on the Scorecard repo. Amongst all of the documentation fixes we did, 4030 was the only technical issue we fixed where we had to understand and modify code functions. We spent about a week on this issue to find out the fix was just one line of code. It was a little frustrating because it involved a concept I just learned more about this year involving inheritance. Kemon, Jordin, and I worked on this issue a lot independently and Kemon found a solution and presented it to us. We then opened our PR, had to update our commit message, and got our fix merged. It was satisfying to have the checkpoint of completion.

OpenSSF Scorecard is definitely much more difficult to contribute to when compared to p5.js. The one thing that makes me prefer OpenSSF however is the incredibly quick response times from the maintainers. I think the barrier for entry frees up a lot of their time for communication. I really appreciated how the maintainers would provide resources when engaging in discussion with us. Spencer was a very big highlight for my experience with OpenSSF.

Coming back, I didn’t anticipate any difficulties teaching others open source. I’ve tutored before and thought the experience would translate fairly easily, but it didn’t completely. I’d add a fair warning that when it comes to something as complex as open source you’ll need to be prepared to repeat steps to guide others through making contributions. You’ll also need to consider that not everything you know will be as obvious to other, and that sometimes giving hints can make the situation more confusing.
