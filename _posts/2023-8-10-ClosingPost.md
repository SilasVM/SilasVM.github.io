My previous goal was to get better at writing, and contribute some code to an open source project. I’m proud that I was able to improve on my technical writing skills, and improve my ability to convey my thoughts using supporting documents. What really got me to make progress on this was just researching problems, and detailing what the problem was, how I solved it, and adding evidence to my pull requests. I didn’t write any papers during this experience however. I think I’ll ask one of my mentors or someone at NSU’s writing center to assign me a topic to write about for accountability. 

One of my most challenging problems I’ve worked on so far was adding a .gitattributes file to the p5.js repository. It was an all-intensive issue, and I had seen previously that an attempt from 6 years ago was closed as the contributor was unable to convince the steward that it was valuable. There was also an issue closed in January of this year(6 months prior) which didn’t really offer a solution but further addressed the problem. I saw a much more recent issue running a series of tests that was caused due to incorrect line endings, and had encountered that when working with a project called GitKit. I offered a short fix and began working on a more solid fix privately. Then I opened a PR to add .gitattributes and explained how it would help solve the problem, and I added screenshots showing that it worked. I had some other windows users test it in my cohort, but I’m still waiting on it to be accepted.

I think this was also the most rewarding issue. From the records I’ve seen my approach is the only one so far that has been considered by a steward. It gives me a lot of internal validation, regardless of if it gets merged or not. I know that if not now, someone down the line can look back at my contribution and potentially use it to bring up the issue again.

The most valuable thing I learned is how important a support system is. A good support system can help you feel comfortable wherever you go, and with whatever you’re trying to do. I plan to build connections with more intention now than I used to. I want to have a wide variety of supporters and people that I can support as well so we can reach our goals with the help of each other. I’ve been thinking about grad school as well, and I now have more knowledge of my options, and I’m 100% confident that I could be successful with any path I choose. 

I feel very competent when it comes to contributing to open source now. I know how to judge whether a project would be good for me or not, and whether a specific issue is worth working on. I also know some concrete first steps to take before contributing to a project to make sure what I’m doing is procedurally correct for that project.

I do want to stay engaged with p5.js. For now my plan will be to check in every Monday to see if there’s anything I’d like to work on. I also keep constant tabs on my email(every day), so I’ll be able to see if my current open pr’s get merged or if anything is needed of me to get it merged in.

I would love to keep up with Catalyst, and if I could help by peer-mentoring future catalyst students I think that would be really enjoyable. I’ve been thinking about getting back into tutoring, and I think this would be a really good opportunity for that.
