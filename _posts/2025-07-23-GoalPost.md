title: 2025-07-28 - Open Source Mentorship Goals 2025
---

Since I'm experienced with both Open Source and Mentoring, my goals have been changing a bit. Some of my goals during this program have included getting our new contributors started on code contributions as soon as possible. I think it's great to start with non-code issues or doc fixes, but I've seen that a lot of the discomfort with contributing to Open Source projects surrounds the code contributions themselves. In an effort to combat that I've been looking more into code issues and teaching the idea of getting as much assistance as needed from project maintainers. The p5.js group I'm leading now has made a lot of progress in the communication surrounding a [code issue](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/981#issuecomment-3120547316) and the claiming of it. We'll be working on it more and hopefully have a merged PR is the upcoming days.
