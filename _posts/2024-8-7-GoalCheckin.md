So far to contribute towards OpenSSF we’ve done a few learning exercises. First we looked at some documentation. We looked at the Readme and contributing documents. We also learned how to setup scorecards in our own repositories. After that we did some exercises for the language GO, OpenSSF’s primary language. And we modified some of the checks that OpenSSF uses when rating a repository.

Since working with OSSF I’ve learned about package vulnerabilities that open source projects may have. I’ve also been learning a lot more about the nature of the GO language and how the different files and packages interact with each other. GO isn’t too different in structure from some other programming languages I’ve used. I’ve also learned more about easier workflows we can use such as codespace.

During this final week I’m hoping to have my team finish one code fix. We’ve been getting a lot closer as we keep looking into it and I’m confident we’ll be opening a pull request soon.
